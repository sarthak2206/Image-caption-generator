# Image-caption-generator
A Python-based deep learning model that automatically generates descriptive captions for images. It combines computer vision and natural language processing, using CNNs for image analysis and RNNs for language generation. Trained on a dataset of paired images and captions, it associates visual features with textual descriptions, for image indexing.
