# Image-caption-generator
A Python-based deep learning model that automatically generates descriptive captions for images. It combines computer vision and natural language processing, using CNNs for image analysis and RNNs for language generation. Trained on a dataset of paired images and captions, it associates visual features with textual descriptions, for image indexing.

This might not be accurate because the data is trained with very small amount of data because of device limitaions.
After getting all your model and other thing run in cmd, vscode etc. type python app.py.
